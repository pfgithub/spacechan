**usage**  
Edit a channel name and SpaceChan will automatically replace the dashes with spaces.

**disabling**  
To disable for a specific channel, edit that channel's settings and make it so SpaceChan does not have permission to Manage or Send Messages in that channel. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QTaqd77.png)

**errors**  
SpaceChan should send a descriptive error message to the channel you tried to edit if it can't add spaces.

If SpaceChan does not work at all, try using it on a channel where it has permission to read and send messages. That should give a descriptive error message of what went wrong.

If you have any issues, join the support server or submit an issue on github (linked below)
